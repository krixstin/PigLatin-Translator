:pig: : :hammer: (still in progress)

## About  
The PigLatin Translator converts **English** to **Pig Latin** following three rules:
1. If a word starts with a consonant and a vowel, put the first letter of the word at the end of the word and add "ay." <br/>pig-> igpay
3. If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay." <br/>child => ildchay 
4. If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word. <br/>eat->eatway
